League Overseer
================

This is a BZFlag plug-in that allows official league servers to communicate with the league website to automatically transmit match reports and handle team data.

Documentation
-------------

Due to the documentation becoming overwhelming for a single README file, all of the documentation has been moved to its dedicated [website](http://allejo.github.io/leagueOverSeer/).
